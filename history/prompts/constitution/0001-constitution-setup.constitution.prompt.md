# Constitution Setup for Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Prompt Text
```
Write a Constitution for the book "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" that strictly governs technical accuracy, educational structure, consistency, simulation-first robotics practice, code quality, safety, and review workflow.

The book is creating  using Docusaurus and deployment on Vercel.
```

## Response Text
Created a comprehensive constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project that governs technical accuracy, educational structure, consistency, simulation-first robotics practice, code quality, safety, and review workflow, using Docusaurus for creation and Vercel for deployment.

## Outcome Impact
Established governance principles for the textbook project that will ensure technical accuracy, educational effectiveness, consistency, safety, and quality throughout the development process.

## Files Summary
- .specify/memory/constitution.md: Updated with comprehensive principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project

## Tests Summary
No tests created as this was a documentation/governance task.

## Next Prompts
- Create initial specification for the textbook using /sp.specify
- Design the textbook structure and content organization
- Implement initial textbook content using SpeckitPlus and Claude CLI

## Reflection Note
The constitution establishes a strong foundation for the textbook project with clear principles around technical accuracy, educational structure, and safety considerations that are critical for a Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Constitution addresses technical accuracy requirements
- [x] Constitution includes educational structure guidelines
- [x] Constitution covers consistency standards
- [x] Constitution includes simulation-first robotics practices
- [x] Constitution addresses code quality standards
- [x] Constitution includes safety and ethical considerations
- [x] Constitution covers review workflow requirements
- [x] Constitution specifies Docusaurus and Vercel technology stack

## Failure Modes Observed
None observed - the constitution was successfully created with all required elements.

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality
Consider adding more specific measurable criteria for technical accuracy verification processes.
