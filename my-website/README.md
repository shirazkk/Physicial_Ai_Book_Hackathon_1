This is the Docusaurus-based frontend for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

## Installation

npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Contributing

For information about adding new content to the book, see [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy

```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
