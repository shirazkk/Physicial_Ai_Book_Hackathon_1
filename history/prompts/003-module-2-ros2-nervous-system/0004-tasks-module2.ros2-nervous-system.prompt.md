# Tasks for Module 2 Robotic Nervous System with ROS 2

## Prompt Text
```

```

## Response Text
Successfully generated comprehensive tasks for Module 2: Robotic Nervous System with ROS 2. Created tasks.md with 48 specific tasks organized across 7 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 4 User Stories corresponding to the 4 required chapters. Tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers [P], and story labels [US1-US4]. Each user story is organized to be independently testable with clear implementation goals. The tasks follow the specification priorities (P1-P4) and include content creation, exercises, solutions, and implementation guides for each chapter.

## Outcome Impact
Established detailed implementation roadmap for Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with clear, actionable tasks organized by user story to enable independent development and testing. The tasks provide a structured path from basic ROS 2 architecture to advanced nervous system patterns.

## Files Summary
- specs/003-module-2-ros2-nervous-system/tasks.md: Complete task breakdown with 48 specific tasks organized across 7 phases

## Tests Summary
No automated tests created as this was task breakdown work, but implementation fulfills all requirements specified in the original specification.

## Next Prompts
- Implement Chapter 1: Understanding ROS 2 Architecture and Communication Patterns
- Implement Chapter 2: Bridging Python-based AI Agents to Robot Controllers
- Implement Chapter 3: Understanding URDF for Humanoid Robot Description and Control
- Implement Chapter 4: Implementing Robotic Nervous System Patterns
- Create implementation plan for Module 3

## Reflection Note
The task breakdown successfully organized all work according to the four user stories from the specification. Each story is designed to be independently testable and builds upon the foundational concepts. The parallel execution opportunities are clearly marked, and the MVP approach focusing on User Story 1 provides a clear starting point.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation
- [x] All 4 user stories from specification included as separate phases
- [x] Tasks follow required format with checkboxes, IDs, and labels
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities identified with [P] markers
- [x] Story dependencies clearly marked with [US1-US4] labels
- [x] Implementation strategy includes MVP and incremental delivery
- [x] All tasks include specific file paths for clarity

## Failure Modes Observed
None observed - all task breakdown requirements were completed successfully with appropriate organization and formatting.

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality
Consider adding more specific guidance for future task breakdowns to identify the most critical implementation dependencies early in the process.
