# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy and Verification
All content related to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics must be technically accurate, verified against current research literature, and validated through simulation or practical implementation. Mathematical formulations, code examples, and algorithm descriptions must be peer-reviewed and tested before publication.

### II. Educational Structure and Progressive Learning
Content must follow a logical pedagogical progression from foundational concepts to advanced topics. Each chapter must build upon previous knowledge with clearly defined learning objectives, prerequisite knowledge statements, and assessment criteria to ensure effective student comprehension.

### III. Consistency and Standardization
All content, code examples, terminology, and notation must maintain consistency throughout the textbook. Standardized formatting, naming conventions, and presentation styles must be followed to provide a cohesive learning experience.

### IV. Simulation-First Robotics Practice
The textbook emphasizes simulation-first approaches to robotics development. All practical examples must be demonstrated in simulation environments before real-world application, ensuring safety and accessibility for students without access to physical hardware.

### V. Code Quality and Best Practices
All code examples must adhere to industry best practices for robotics and AI development, including proper documentation, error handling, modularity, and maintainability. Code must be compatible with modern robotics frameworks and libraries.

### VI. Safety and Ethical Considerations
All content must emphasize safety protocols, ethical considerations, and responsible AI practices. Safety warnings, risk assessments, and ethical implications must be clearly presented for all physical AI and robotics applications.

## Content Standards and Technology Stack
- All content must be created using Docusaurus for consistent documentation structure
- Deployment must be performed on Vercel for optimal performance and accessibility
- All code examples must be tested in appropriate simulation environments (e.g., Gazebo, PyBullet, Mujoco)
- Content must be accessible to diverse learners with multiple modalities (text, diagrams, code, videos)
- All mathematical concepts must include intuitive explanations alongside formal notation

## Review and Quality Assurance Workflow
- All content must undergo technical review by domain experts
- Code examples must be verified by independent implementation
- Educational effectiveness must be validated through user testing
- Regular updates must be scheduled to reflect advances in the field
- All changes must pass automated quality checks before merging

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices for this textbook project. All content contributions must comply with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require approval from the editorial board and must be documented with clear rationale. All pull requests must be verified for compliance with these principles before merging.
